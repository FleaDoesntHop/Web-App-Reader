# Web-App-Reader
This is a exercise mimic of the original online fiction reader app of dushu.xiaomi.com.  The codes were written under the guidance of a tutorial video delivered by Yuan Ren, current Lead Front-end Web Developer of Meituan.

To run the app, node.js as well as its dependencies specified in the package.json file are needed. So make sure that you have them all properly installed and type in "npm.start" or "node app.js" in the installed node.js command prompt window, and then visit your local host on 127.0.0.1:3000, and you are good to go! Feel free to fork or download and give me whatever feedback as you like.

Due respect goes to Mr. Yuan Ren for his great tutorial video, and all intellectual property relating to the Reader App belongs to Xiaomi.
